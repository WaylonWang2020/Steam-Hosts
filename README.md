# Steam-Hosts
In order to use the steam platform normally, we need to modify something

```
ipconfig /displaydns
ipconfig /flushdns
```
```
store.steampowered.com
steamcommunity.com
```
```
**nslookup store.steampowered.com**
```
```
"D:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" **-community="https://steamcommunity.com"**
```
